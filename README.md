Likelihood models for HIV epidemiological data

As of this writing, UNAIDS provides many tools to countries to estimate HIV indicators. These vary by epidemic setting and data availability. A long-term goal of the UNAIDS Reference Group on Modelling, Estimates, and Projections has been to consolidate these tools into a single "Symphony" model. The types of data used by the current UNAIDS tools are as many and varied as the instruments available to a percussion section, hence the name of this package.
